See `COPYING` for more\r\ninformation or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.\r\n\r\nDevelopment process\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nDevelopers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think\r\ntheir feature or bug fix is ready.\r\n\r\nIf it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Litecoin\r\ndevelopment team members simply pulls it.\r\n\r\nIf it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch\r\nsubmitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the\r\n[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).\r\n\r\nThe patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.\r\nDevelopers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't\r\nmatch the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are\r\ncontroversial.\r\n\r\nThe `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be\r\ncompletely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created\r\nregularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Litecoin.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTesting and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull\r\nrequests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and\r\nremember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people\r\nlots of money.\r\n\r\n### Automated Testing\r\n\r\nDevelopers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to\r\nsubmit new unit tests for old code.\r\n\r\nUnit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:\r\n\r\n    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test\r\n\r\nUnit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:\r\n\r\n    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro\r\n    make -f Makefile.test\r\n    ./prospercoin-qt_test\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
